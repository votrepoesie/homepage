    <h4>SPRING 2022</h4>
    <p>This collection was characterized by the use of soft colors, silhouettes that embody fluidity, as well as employing hand-dyed fabrics. Every single piece was dyed with care and required multiple coloring sessions.</p>

    <h4>SPRING 2021</h4>
    <p>I was interested in working with found materials, especially second-hand fabrics from thrift stores and some of my old clothes. Furthermore, quilting was something I enjoyed but never got to experiment with in the form of fashion, which resulted in this colorful quilted jacket.</p>

    <h4>WINTER 2020</h4>
    <p>This is the collection that taught me how to sew and construct designs from 2D to 3D with the help of patterns. I had no previous experience besides using the sewing machine to make alterations, and I was drawn to the process of selecting fabrics and combining different textures, which to me was a painterly process. I also took a lot of inspiration from the personalities of my models and what I envision them wearing.</p>
